 *  Change Log
 *  2016-01-23:
 *		* refactored tiles making them cleaner and more
 *		  reusable
 *  2015-10-09:
 *		* removed extraneous .tiles > .tile because we don't
 *		  change the styles between the two instances, so why
 *		  target so specifically?
 *  2015-09-17:
 *		* created the basic markup and styles for tiles with
 *		  a variation for appended actions as opposed to the
 *		  traditional overlay.
